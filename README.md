# Medical Application for Leukemia Patients using Deep Learning and Steganography

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) affects more than 500,000 people yearly all across the world. Highly accurate detection of leukemic cells in blood stream without any chemical process will help the healthcare industry not just with cost, but will also save time as the outcome can be processed in a fraction of time. The project aims to build an open-sourced web application specifically meant for inferring whether the microscopic cell imaging indicates the presence of leukemia blasts. The system would request for the microscopic image, process it and pass it to a pre-modelled Deep Learning algorithm to get prediction probability of Leukemia blast. The information would then be hidden in the said image and returned to the patient (so that the patient does not get to know). After the patients passes the image to the doctor, the doctor can use this image to manually infer, and also pass the image to this application and get prediction probabilities to back their claim and have a better understanding.
